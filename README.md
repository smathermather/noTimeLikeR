## R Approaches to temporal disaggregation

Limitations here might be that many temporal disaggregation approaches assume summary data (rather than instantaneous or sample data) is available for each timestep.

## R Approaches for Time Series Modeling

### Packages

* Forecast (retired)
	* Uses ts data structures
	* https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/forecast/versions/8.15
	* https://otexts.com/fpp2/
* Fable
	* Uses tsibble data structure / tidyverse approach
	* https://fable.tidyverts.org/
* TimeTK
* modeltime
	* Lots of options here, but this seems like a pretty nice aggregator for different approaches including classical and
